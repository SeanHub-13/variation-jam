## Description

This is a trilogy of games that follow the official storyline of GooseWorld originally started in my art jam.

Variation 1 - A game where you shoot cans of Art Jam (paint) and armoured geese with a gravity effected crossbow.

Variation 2 - A game where you shoot cans of Art Jam (paint) and robot geese motherships in a sad attempt to save the last of humanity.

Variation 3 - A game where humanity has lost to the geese and you are brainwashed forever.
